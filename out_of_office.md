1.“I will be back in the office [in two weeks] and have limited Wi-Fi connection in the meantime.” It is safe to assume that readers of this column are familiar with something like this message (which, like all the others cited below, comes from real life). As with all aspects of office culture, the autoreply has evolved over time—and more quickly in the past 18 plague months. Good etiquette has not always kept up.

"我将在[两周后]回到办公室，在此期间，我的Wi-Fi连接有限。" 可以假定，本专栏的读者对类似这样的信息很熟悉（就像下面引用的所有其他信息一样，来自于现实生活）。与办公室文化的所有方面一样，自动回复随着时间的推移而演变，在过去的18个月里演变得更快。良好的礼仪并不总是跟得上。

注释：
1. plague | BrE pleɪɡ, AmE pleɪɡ |
2. etiquette | BrE ˈɛtɪkɛt,ɛtɪˈkɛt, AmE ˈɛdəkət,ˈɛdəˌkɛt |

2.The precursor of the electronic “out of office” is sometimes found in Mediterranean countries, where a handwritten note taped to a shop front announces to the world: “Closed for August, back in September”. The digital autoreply was initially a quirk of Microsoft, a software giant, dating back to the company’s Xenix email system of the late 1980s, before bleeding into the mainstream in the following two decades.
电子 "停业 "的前身有时在地中海国家被发现，那里的商店门前贴着一张手写的纸条，向全世界宣布："8月关闭，9月回来"。数字自动回复最初是软件巨头微软公司的一个怪癖，可以追溯到该公司20世纪80年代末的Xenix电子邮件系统，然后在随后的20年中逐渐成为主流。

注释：
1. [intransitive] bleed (into something) to spread from one area of something to another area

In those early days responses tended to be terse and to the point. That style persists to this day, especially in the higher echelons of corporate hierarchies. c-suite executives’ autoreplies seldom feature jokes or emojis—if, that is, they are set up in the first place. A chief executive does not have to explain her or his absence or lack of prompt response, except possibly to the board (which will invariably have been informed of the boss’s movements).
早期人们的回复通常较为简明扼要。这种风格一直延续到今天，尤其是在公司高层。若高管们提前设置回复，其内容很少带有笑话和表情符号。首席执行官无需解释自己为何缺席或未及时回复，除非是向董事会解释（而董事会往往了解老板的动向）。

注释：
1. invariably：不变地;总是;始终如一地 If something invariably happens or is invariably true, it always happens or is always true.

Lower down the pecking order, however, people increasingly try to put their personal mark on their autoreplies. And if this stand-in Bartleby’s inbox is a guide, creativity has burgeoned in the age of lockdowns and remote work. Some try to be witty (“I will have limited enthusiasm for access to email”). Others share (“I am out of the office getting married!”). Others still plump for exoticism (“Please note that I am out travelling in a remote area in Greenland and will have no internet or phone connection for the majority of the period”).
然而，在低层，人们越来越多地尝试在他们的自动回复中加入个人的标记。如果这个替身巴特比的收件箱是一个指南，那么在禁闭和远程工作的时代，创造力已经激增了。一些人试图表现得诙谐（"我对访问电子邮件的热情有限"）。其他人则分享（"我已经离开办公室结婚了！"）。还有一些人仍然喜欢异国情调（"请注意，我在格陵兰岛的一个偏远地区旅行，在大部分时间里没有互联网或电话连接"）。

Often, the autoreply involves people beyond the sender and recipient. Your columnist has on numerous occasions been named as the person to whom addressees of her colleagues’ autoreplies ought to direct queries. That can have long-running consequences. Public-relations types still refuse to remove her email address from their mailing lists even though she has patiently, and repeatedly, explained that climate change is not her beat so there is no point in sending her daily press releases about agroforestry in Kenya. Occasionally autoreplies turn into a cyberspace version of a treasure hunt. During the summer Bartleby’s email address was given out while she herself was on holiday so the recipient ended up being redirected again.
通常，自动回复涉及发件人和收件人之外的人。你的专栏作家曾多次被指定为她同事的自动回复的收件人应该直接询问的人。这可能会产生长期的后果。公共关系人员仍然拒绝将她的电子邮件地址从他们的邮件列表中删除，尽管她已经耐心地反复解释说气候变化不是她的工作，所以没有必要每天向她发送有关肯尼亚农林业的新闻稿。偶尔，自动回复会变成网络版的寻宝游戏。在夏天，巴特比的电子邮件地址被送出去了，而她自己却在度假，所以收件人最后又被重定向了。

注释：
1. agroforestry: agriculture incorporating the cultivation and conservation of trees. 
2. cyberspace: 网络空间 In computer technology, cyberspace refers to data banks and networks, considered as a place.
3. off one's beat 不在行的,不熟悉的,一窍不通的


Such foibles notwithstanding, most office workers have no problem with the “out of office”. A survey of 1,000 people conducted in 2015 by Microsoft found that most respondents liked the practice. That is partly because setting it can mark the beginning of a holiday (which it did for 77% of the surveyed). But 60% also confessed to enjoying a jolly reply received from others.
尽管有这样的缺点，大多数上班族对 "不在办公室 "没有意见。微软在2015年对1000人进行的一项调查发现，大多数受访者喜欢这种做法。这部分是因为设置它可以标志着一个假期的开始（对77%的被调查者来说是这样）。但60%的人也承认喜欢从别人那里收到的快乐回复。

注释：
1. 小怪癖;(性格上无伤大雅的)缺点 A foible is a habit or characteristic that someone has which is considered rather strange, foolish, or bad but which is also considered unimportant.
2. 令人愉快的；欢快的；惬意的 A jolly event is lively and enjoyable.


Still, clear dos and don’ts exist. As an “out of office” connoisseur (and victim), Bartleby recommends being straightforward and informative. State the dates when you are away. If the period of absence is longer than a typical holiday, a word of explanation may be in order (jury duty, parental leave, sabbatical).
不过，还是有明确的该做的和不该做的。作为一个 "不在办公室 "的鉴赏家（也是受害者），巴特比建议要直截了当，信息量大。说明你离开的日期。如果离开的时间比典型的假期长，那么就需要解释一下（陪审团职责、育儿假、休假）。


The message itself does not have to be a labour of love. Oversharing is awkward. “I’m on pto” (paid time off) has been common in the corona-era despite the inelegance of reminding strangers that you received compensation for being unavailable. Humble-brags or an air of self-importance strike a false note.
信息本身不一定是爱的结晶。过度分享是令人尴尬的。"我在休假"（带薪休假）在冠冕堂皇的时代已经很常见了，尽管提醒陌生人你因为没有时间而得到了补偿，这很不礼貌。谦虚的吹嘘或自以为是的态度会造成错误的印象。

注释：
1. labour of love: something done for personal pleasure and not for money 
2. strike a false note: to behave inappropriately
humble brag an ostensibly modest or self-deprecating statement whose actual purpose is to draw attention to something of which one is proud.

Trying to be funny often falls flat on its face. Including suggestions to follow you on Twitter or emojis of an umbrella on a beach are best avoided. Three in ten respondents to Microsoft’s survey reported succumbing to sentiments of envy and fear of missing out upon being notified that others enjoyed tropical vacations. Veering off-topic, whether by including personal confessions or quotes from Muhammad Ali, shows not erudition or finesse but a distracted mind given to rambling. It is like having water on the knee—the best things found in the wrong places.
试图搞笑的做法往往会落空。包括在Twitter上关注你的建议或在海滩上打伞的表情符号都最好避免。在微软的调查中，十分之三的受访者报告说，在得知别人享受热带假期时，他们屈服于羡慕和害怕错过的情绪。偏离主题，无论是包括个人忏悔还是引用穆罕默德-阿里的名言，都没有显示出博学或精明，而是显示出一种心不在焉的漫不经心。这就像膝盖上有水一样，在错误的地方找到最好的东西。

注释：
1. If someone falls flat on their face when they try to do something, they fail or make an embarrassing mistake
2. fear of missing out: 错失恐惧症（英语：Fear of missing out，简称：FOMO），也称社群恐慌症等，是指一种由患得患失所产生持续性的焦虑，得上这种症的人总会感到别人在自己不在时经历了什么非常有意义的事情
3. （突然）转向,改变方向 If something veers in a certain direction, it suddenly moves in that direction.
4. Knee effusion, sometimes called water on the knee, occurs when excess fluid accumulates in or around the knee joint.

Being aware people want your attention before you return to your post can be instrumental in the management of any other large organisation. But if you are surfing in Maui, attending a conference, running an ultra-marathon in the Mojave desert, writing a novel, or taking time off to paint your mother’s garage, no one really needs to know the details.
在你回到你的岗位之前，意识到人们希望得到你的关注，这在任何其他大型组织的管理中都是非常重要的。但是，如果你在毛伊岛冲浪，参加一个会议，在莫哈韦沙漠跑超级马拉松，写一本小说，或者请假去刷你母亲的车库，没有人真的需要知道这些细节。

1. 有助益的;有帮助的;起作用的 Someone or something that is instrumental in a process or event helps to make it happen.
