The age of energy abundance is dead
能源充足的时代已经过去了

For much of the past half-decade, the operative word in the energy sector was “abundance”. An industry that had long sought to ration the production of fossil fuels to keep prices high suddenly found itself swamped with oversupply, as America’s shale boom lowered the price of oil around the world and clean-energy sources, such as wind and solar, competed with other fuels used for power generation, such as coal and natural gas.

在过去五年的大部分时间里，能源行业的关键词是 "丰富"。随着美国页岩油的繁荣降低了世界各地的石油价格，以及风能和太阳能等清洁能源与煤炭和天然气等其他发电燃料的竞争，这个长期以来试图对化石燃料的生产进行配给以保持高价格的行业突然发现自己被供应过剩所淹没。


In recent weeks, however, it is a shortage of energy, rather than an abundance of it, that has caught the world’s attention. On the surface, its manifestations are mostly unconnected. Britain’s miffed motorists are suffering from a shortage of lorry drivers to deliver petrol. Power cuts in parts of China partly stem from the country’s attempts to curb emissions. Dwindling coal stocks at power stations in India are linked to a surge in the price of imports of the commodity.

然而，在最近几周，引起世界关注的是能源短缺，而不是能源的过剩。从表面上看，其表现形式（多种多样）大多没有联系。英国愤怒的车主正在面临运送汽油的卡车司机的短缺（导致的汽油供应不足）。中国部分地区的停电，部分原因在于该国试图遏制排放。印度发电站的煤炭库存不断减少，与进口商大宗（煤炭）商品价格飙升有关。

Yet an underlying factor is expected to worsen the scarcity in the next few years: a slump in investment in oil wells, natural-gas hubs and coal mines. This is partly a hangover from the period of abundance, with years of overinvestment giving rise to more capital discipline. It is also the result of growing pressures to decarbonise. This year the investment shortfall is one of the main reasons prices of all three energy commodities have soared. European gas prices, though volatile, were near record highs as The Economist went to press. Oil crossed $81 a barrel after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (opec), and producers such as Russia who are part of the opec+ alliance, resisted calls to raise output at a meeting on October 4th.
然而，在未来几年里，一个潜在的因素预计会使稀缺性恶化：对油井、天然气中心和煤矿的投资下滑。这部分是“丰富”时期的遗留问题，多年的过度投资导致了更加谨慎的资本投资克制。这也是日益增长的去碳化压力的结果。今年，投资不足是所有三种能源商品价格飙升的主要原因之一。虽然波动较大，但在欧洲天然气价格在《经济学人》杂志付印时已接近历史高点。在石油输出国组织（opec）和作为opec+联盟成员的俄罗斯等生产国在10月4日的会议上拒绝了提高产量的呼吁后，石油价格突破了每桶81美元。

The potentially inflationary upheaval will not be good for a world that still gets most of its energy from fossil fuels. But it may at least accelerate the shift to greener—and cheaper—sources of energy.
对于一个仍然从化石燃料中获取大部分能源的世界来说，这种潜在的通货膨胀动荡将不是好事。但它至少可能加速向更绿色、更便宜的能源资源的转变。

Start with oil, an industry that needs constant reinvestment just to stand still. A rule of thumb is that oil companies are supposed to allocate about four-fifths of their capital expenditure each year just to stopping their level of reserves from being depleted. Yet annual investment by the industry has fallen from $750bn in 2014 (when oil prices were above $100 a barrel) to an estimated $350bn this year, reckons Saad Rahim of Trafigura, a commodity trader. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, a bank, say that over the same period, the number of years’ worth of current production held in reserves in some of the world’s biggest projects has fallen from 50 to about 25. A supply crunch was averted last year because the covid-19 pandemic clobbered oil demand. But once the world economy started to recover, it was only a matter of time before a squeeze started to emerge.
首先来说石油行业，这个行业需要不断的再投资才能保证供应的稳定。一个经验法则是，石油公司每年应该将大约五分之四的资本支出（用以再投资），才能阻止其储量水平被耗尽。然而，大宗商品交易商Trafigura的Saad Rahim认为，该行业的年度投资已经从2014年的7500亿美元（当时油价在每桶100美元以上）下降到今年的约3500亿美元。高盛(Goldman Sachs)银行的分析师说，在这段时期，世界上最大的一些项目的储量（以相对于本年产量计），已经从50年降至约25年。去年，由于covid-19大流行病削弱了石油需求，供应紧张的情况得以避免。但是，一旦世界经济开始复苏，需求挤压开始出现只是时间问题。

The industry would usually respond to robust demand and higher prices by investing to drill more oil. But that is harder in an era of decarbonisation. For a start, big private-sector oil companies, such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, are being pressed by investors to treat oil and gas investments like week-old fish. That is either because their shareholders reckon that demand for oil will eventually peak, making long-term projects uneconomic, or because they prefer to hold stakes in companies that support the transition to clean energy. Even though prices are rising, investment in oil shows no sign of picking up. The Economist has looked at capital-spending forecasts for American and European commodity producers in 2021 and 2022 compared with 2019. Whereas mining firms predict big increases in capital expenditure, energy investment is expected to fall sharply. Oil firms are instead giving excess cash back to shareholders.
该行业通常会通过投资钻探更多石油来应对强劲的需求和更高的价格。但在一个去碳化的时代，这就更难了。首先，大型私营石油公司，如埃克森美孚和荷兰皇家壳牌石油公司，正被投资者逼着把石油和天然气投资当作时间太久发愁的鱼。这要么是因为他们的股东估计对石油的需求最终会达到顶峰，长期项目经济价值低，要么是因为他们更愿意持有支持向清洁能源过渡的公司的股份。即使价格在上涨，对石油的投资也没有显示出回升的迹象。《经济学人》调查了美国和欧洲商品生产商在2021年和2022年的资本支出预测，与2019年相比。矿业公司预测资本支出将大幅增加，而能源投资预计将急剧下降。石油公司反而将多余的现金回馈给股东。

7 Another factor inhibiting oil investment is the behaviour of opec+ countries. The half-decade of relatively low prices during the “age of abundance”, which reached its nadir with a price collapse at the start of the pandemic, gutted state coffers. That cut funding for investment. As prices recover, governments’ priority is not to expand oil-production capacity but to shore up national budgets. Moreover, state-run producers are cautious, worried that a new flare-up of covid-19 cases could hit demand again. And as Oswald Clint of Bernstein, an investment firm, puts it, many are wondering “Why not just ride this high price for a while?” In any case, even if the rally were eventually to inspire investment, it would take several years to meaningfully raise production.

阻碍石油投资的另一个因素是OPEC+国家的行为。在长达半个世纪的"富足时代"中，石油价格始终处于低位，而在全球新冠疫情开始之初，更是跌入谷底，几乎崩盘，这导致国家财政惨遭重创，也削减了投资的金额。随着价格的恢复，政府优先考量的不是扩大石油的产能，而是支持国家预算。此外，国营生产商也很谨慎，他们担心新冠疫情的恶化会再次打击需求。正如投资公司伯恩斯坦（Bernstein）的奥斯瓦德·克林特（Oswald Clint）所说，许多人都在想，"为什么不让价格在高位上‘飞一会儿’，趁机大赚一笔？" 无论如何，即使价格反弹最终能拉动投资，也要几年之后我们才能看到产量的显著提升。

8 Lower investment in oil has a spillover effect on the output of natural gas, which is often a by-product of drilling for crude. Added to that is a dearth of liquefied natural gas (lng) terminals for shipping gas from places where it remains relatively easy to access (America) to those where it is scarcer (Asia and Europe). Given the long time it takes to build facilities, the lack of spare terminal capacity in America is expected to last at least until 2025.
石油投资的减少对天然气的产出有溢出效应，而天然气往往是钻探原油的副产品。此外，用于将天然气从相对容易获取的地方（美国）运往天然气稀缺的地方（亚洲和欧洲）的液化天然气（LNG）集散站也很匮乏。鉴于建造相关设施需要的时间很长，美国可用集散能力紧缺的问题预计至少会持续到2025年。

Investment in thermal coal is weakest of all. Even in China and India, which are planning new coal-fired power plants, the mood has swung against the dirtiest fossil fuel, because of both its carbon emissions and its effect on air quality. Yet with demand likely to be pushed up as China potentially heads into a cold winter, and with India struggling with supplies, coal may be in the throes of its last hurrah.
对动力煤的投资是最弱的。即使是在计划新建燃煤电厂的中国和印度，由于其碳排放和对空气质量的影响，人们对这种最肮脏的化石燃料的态度也发生了变化。然而，随着中国可能进入寒冷的冬天，需求可能被推高，以及印度在供应方面的挣扎，煤炭可能会有一次回光返照。

注释：
1. thermal coal: 动力煤指用于作为动力原料的煤炭。一般狭义上就是指用于火力发电的煤。从广义上来讲，凡是以发电、机车推进、锅炉燃烧等为目的，产生动力而使用的煤炭都属于动力用煤，简称动力煤。
2. hurrah: 喝彩声

All this places fossil-fuel producers in something of a bind. A slump in investment could enable some oil, gas and coal investors to make out like bandits. But the longer prices stay high, the more likely it becomes that the transition to clean energy ultimately buries the fossil-fuel industry. Consumers, in the meantime, must brace for more shortages. The age of abundance is dead.
所有这些都使化石燃料生产商陷入了某种困境。投资的低迷可能使一些石油、天然气和煤炭投资者像土匪一样赚钱。但是，价格保持在高位的时间越长，向清洁能源的过渡就越有可能最终葬送化石燃料行业。在此期间，消费者必须为更多的短缺做好准备。丰富的时代已经过去。
