A whistleblower’s leaks could be a turning point for big tech
告密者的泄密事件可能成为大型科技公司的转折点

“YOU ARE a 21st-century American hero,” gushed Ed Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. He was not addressing the founder of one of the country’s largest companies, Facebook, but the woman who found fault with it. Frances Haugen, who had worked at the social-media giant before becoming a whistleblower, testified in front of a Senate subcommittee for over three hours on October 5th, highlighting Facebook’s “moral bankruptcy” and the firm’s downplaying of its harmful impact, including fanning teenage depression and ethnic violence.
马萨诸塞州的民主党参议员埃德-马基(Ed Markey)高兴地说："你是21世纪的美国英雄"。他说的不是这个国家最大的公司之一Facebook的创始人，而是那个发现它有问题的女人。10月5日，在成为举报人之前曾在这家社交媒体巨头工作的弗朗西斯-豪根（Frances Haugen）在参议院小组委员会面前作了三个多小时的证词，强调了Facebook的 "道德破产 "和该公司对其有害影响的淡化，包括煽动青少年抑郁症和种族暴力。


The public has long suspected Facebook of two-faced toxicity. What was lacking were the damning internal communiqués to prove it. That changed when Ms Haugen released a trove of corporate documents to regulators and to the Wall Street Journal. Facebook’s own private research, for example, found that its photo-sharing site, Instagram, worsened teens’ suicidal thoughts and eating disorders. Yet it still made a point of sending young users engaging content that stoked their anxiety—while proceeding to develop a version of its site for those under the age of 13. (Facebook has since paused those plans, due to public pressure.)
公众早就怀疑Facebook有两面性的毒性。但缺乏的是可以证明这一点的令人震惊的内部公报。当豪根女士向监管机构和《华尔街日报》公布了大量的公司文件后，情况发生了变化。例如，Facebook自己的私人研究发现，其照片分享网站Instagram会加剧青少年的自杀念头和饮食失调。然而，它仍然向年轻用户发送刺激他们焦虑的内容--同时着手为13岁以下的人开发一个网站版本。(由于公众压力，Facebook后来暂停了这些计划）。)

Senators, who cannot agree on such uncontroversial things as paying for the government’s expenses, united against a common enemy and promised Ms Haugen that they would hold Facebook to account. But the firm has survived scandals before. Congress has repeatedly called in tech bosses for angry questioning and public shaming without taking direct action afterwards. Congressional hearings “have become like ‘Ground Hog Day’ and haven’t really mattered”, says Paul Gallant of Cowen Washington Research Group, which tracks tech policy. In 2018 a different whistleblower outed Facebook for its sketchy collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, a research organisation that allowed users’ data to be collected without their consent and used for political profiling by Donald Trump’s campaign. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, went to Washington, DC to apologise, and in 2019 America’s consumer-protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission, agreed to a $5bn settlement with Facebook. That is the largest fine ever levied against a tech firm. However, no laws were changed to rein in the company’s misbehaviour.

参议员们在支付政府开支等无争议的事情上无法达成一致，他们团结起来，对抗一个共同的敌人，并向豪根女士承诺，他们将追究Facebook的责任。但这家公司以前也曾在丑闻中幸存下来。国会曾多次召集科技公司老板进行愤怒的质询和公开羞辱，事后却没有采取直接行动。追踪科技政策的考恩华盛顿研究集团的保罗-盖伦说，国会听证会 "已经变得像'土拨鼠日'，并没有真正发挥作用"。2018年，一位不同的举报人揭露了Facebook与剑桥分析公司(Cambridge Analytica)的粗略合作，该研究机构允许未经用户同意收集用户数据，并被唐纳德-特朗普的竞选团队用于政治分析。脸书的创始人马克-扎克伯格前往华盛顿特区道歉，2019年，美国的消费者保护机构--联邦贸易委员会同意与脸书达成50亿美元的和解。这是有史以来对一家科技公司征收的最大罚款。然而，没有改变任何法律来约束该公司的不当行为。

This new whistleblowing incident could be a turning point, says Blair Levin of New Street Research. Social media’s harmful effects on children and teenagers is a concern that transcends partisanship and is easier to understand than sneaky data-gathering, viral misinformation and other social-networking sins.
新街口研究公司的布莱尔-莱文说，这起新的举报事件可能是一个转折点。社交媒体对儿童和青少年的有害影响是一个超越党派的担忧，比偷偷摸摸的数据收集、病毒式的错误信息和其他社交网络的罪恶更容易理解。

If Congress does follow through with legislation, it is likely to focus narrowly on protecting children online, as opposed to broader reforms, for which there is still no political consensus. For example, Congress could update and strengthen the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which was passed in 1998 and bars the collection of data from children under the age of 13. Some want to extend protections to teenagers over that age as well. Other legislative proposals take aim at manipulative marketing and design features that make social media so addictive for the young.
如果国会真的跟进立法，它很可能只专注于保护在线儿童，而不是更广泛的改革，因为在这方面仍然没有政治共识。例如，国会可以更新和加强《儿童在线隐私保护法》（COPPA），该法于1998年通过，禁止收集13岁以下儿童的数据。一些人希望将保护范围扩大到超过这个年龄的青少年。其他立法提案针对的是操纵性的营销和设计特点，这些特点使社交媒体对年轻人如此上瘾。

However, Ms Haugen’s most significant impact on big tech may be inspiring others to come forward and blow the whistle on their employers’ malfeasance. Whistleblower Aid, a legal support group that has helped Ms Haugen’s case, has fielded more calls since her revelations were made public. “A case like this one opens the floodgates and will trigger hundreds more cases,” predicts Steve Kohn, a lawyer who has represented several high-profile whistleblowers. Just look at the scandals within Swiss banking or pharmaceutical firms to understand the viral spread of whistleblowing, he says. According to Siri Nelson of the National Whistleblower Centre, a legal defence firm, such informers do not just change companies, they “change whole industries”.
然而，豪根女士对大科技公司最重要的影响可能是激励其他人站出来，对其雇主的渎职行为进行举报。举报人援助组织是一个帮助豪根女士的案件的法律支持组织，自从她的揭露被公开后，该组织接到了更多电话。"曾代表几位高知名度举报人的律师史蒂夫-科恩(Steve Kohn)预测说："像这样的案件打开了闸门，将引发数百起案件。他说，只要看看瑞士银行业或制药公司的丑闻，就能理解举报的病毒式传播。据法律辩护公司国家举报人中心（National Whistleblower Centre）的Siri Nelson称，这些举报人不仅改变了公司，他们 "改变了整个行业"。

There are several factors that make tech ripe for whistleblowing. One is the industry’s culture of flouting rules and a history of non-compliance. Another is a legal framework that makes whistleblowing less threatening and more attractive than it used to be. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in 2010, gives greater protections to whistleblowers by preventing retaliation from employers and by offering rewards to successful cases of up to 10-30% of the money collected from sanctions against a firm. To date the Securities and Exchange Commission has paid out $1bn to 207 whistleblowers, including more than $500m in its 2021 fiscal year.
有几个因素使科技行业的举报时机成熟。一个是该行业蔑视规则的文化和不遵守规则的历史。另一个是一个法律框架，它使举报的威胁性降低，比以前更有吸引力。2010年颁布的《多德-弗兰克法案》为举报人提供了更大的保护，防止雇主的报复行为，并为成功的案件提供奖励，奖励金额高达对公司制裁所得资金的10-30%。到目前为止，证券交易委员会已经向207名举报人支付了10亿美元，其中包括2021年财政年度的5亿多美元。

If the threat of public shaming encourages corporate accountability, that is a good thing. But it could also make tech firms less inclusive and transparent, predicts Matt Perault, a former Facebook executive who is director of the Centre for Technology Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. People may become less willing to share off-the-wall ideas if they worry about public leaks; companies may become less open with their staff; and executives could start including only a handful of trusted senior staff in meetings that might have otherwise been less restricted.
如果公开羞辱的威胁能鼓励企业承担责任，这是一件好事。但它也可能使科技公司的包容性和透明度降低，前Facebook高管、北卡罗来纳大学教堂山分校技术政策中心主任马特-佩罗预测道。如果人们担心公开泄密，他们可能会变得不愿意分享非主流的想法；公司可能会变得对员工不那么开放；高管们可能会开始在原本限制较少的会议中只包括少数几个受信任的高级员工。

Executives are going to have to get used to more leaks. Mr Zuckerberg denied any wrongdoing in a blog, writing that at “the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritise profit over safety and wellbeing. That’s just not true.” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice-president of policy and global affairs, has defended the company and pushed back against Ms Haugen’s allegations in a lengthy memo to the company’s staff. It was barely any time at all before the memo was shared with journalists. Facebook and other big tech firms, which have been criticised for violating people’s privacy online, can no longer count on any privacy either.
高管们将不得不习惯于更多的泄密事件。扎克伯格先生在博客中否认有任何不当行为，他写道："这些指控的核心是我们将利润置于安全和福祉之上的想法。这是不正确的"。Facebook负责政策和全球事务的副总裁尼克-克莱格(Nick Clegg)为公司辩护，并在给公司员工的长篇备忘录中反驳了豪根女士的指控。几乎没有任何时间，该备忘录就被分享给了记者。脸书和其他大型科技公司因侵犯人们的网络隐私而受到批评，它们也不能再指望有什么隐私了。
